     Hello, let's create a maze and find a way
     Enter the height and width of the maze separated by a whitespace, the numbers must be greater than 1
     The first number is height, the second is width
     You enter the wrong number
     Enter the height and width of the maze separated by a whitespace, the numbers must be greater than 1
     The first number is height, the second is width
     There're 2 algorithms for generate a maze, enter a number
     1 - to choose the Prim's algorithm
     2 - to choose the Kruskal's algorithm
     You enter the wrong number of algorithm

     Enter the starting and ending point of the path
The Y coordinate should be greater then 0 and be less than the height (11)
 and the X coordinate should be greater then 0 and be less than the width of the maze (11)
     Enter coordinates of starting point
     The first number is height, the second is width
     Enter coordinates of ending point
     The first number is height, the second is width
     You enter the wrong number
     Enter coordinates of ending point
     The first number is height, the second is width
     There're 2 algorithms for find path from start to end point, enter a number
     1 - to choose the A* (surfaces)
     2 - to choose the BfsSolver

     The path is marked with '*' symbols
     The start point is marked with '@' symbols
     The end point is marked with '#' symbols
     It's end! Congratulations!
